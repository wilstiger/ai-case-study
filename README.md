## Overview and Origin  
OpenAI was incorporated in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and other technology leaders with a vision to ensure that AI serves the greater good. The idea for OpenAI emerged from concerns about the safe development and use of AI technologies. Initially a non-profit, OpenAI transitioned to a capped-profit model to secure substantial funding, including over $1 billion from Microsoft. This funding has been pivotal in developing technologies like ChatGPT which has the potential to revolutionize digital accessibility by enabling more inclusive interactions for all users. The OpenAI API is a powerful tool that can help bridge communication gaps, making digital platforms more accessible. Technologies like ChatGPT are already being used by various platforms to enhance accessibility, ensuring that everyone, including individuals with disabilities, can engage with content more effectively.

## Business Activities  
OpenAI's ChatGPT is designed to solve the problem of digital accessibility by facilitating communication across diverse user groups. The primary customers are businesses, educational institutions, and individuals, including those with disabilities who require accessible digital solutions. The market for digital accessibility is vast, as it touches every industry seeking to comply with accessibility standards and improve user experience.  
OpenAI stands out by offering AI-driven natural language processing that outperforms competitors like Google and Microsoft in accessibility features. The advantage lies in the OpenAI API, which provides customizable, robust solutions for integrating accessibility into various platforms. Technologies such as voice recognition and real-time text generation make these solutions more inclusive. For example, [Be My Eyes](https://www.bemyeyes.com/), a service that uses AI to assist visually impaired individuals, leverages OpenAI’s technology to provide real-time assistance.
